**Server:** http://localhost:8095/
**Script:** `tests/e2e_comprehensive.py`
**Total:** 114 | **Pass:** 114 | **Fail:** 0

## Fixes applied this run

- `js/app.js`: `loadUser()` clears invalid/corrupt ward values on load
- `js/app.js`: `openAdminReportModal()` string-safe id match
- `js/app.js`: `handleReportDeepLink()` toast for missing report (`toast.reportNotFound`)
- `js/app.js`: `getModCfg()` reads moderation config live at submit time
- `js/app.js`: `copyTextSafe()` / improved `fallbackCopy()` for clipboard reliability
- `js/app.js`: `applyTranslations()` calls `updatePersonaUI()` (was broken `renderPersonaBar`)
- `tests/e2e_comprehensive.py`: E09 checks analytics opt-in checkbox (separate from ToS)
- `tests/e2e_comprehensive.py`: `ensure_local_mode()` stabilizes NGO/BMC demo login when Supabase configured
- `js/app.js`: BMC pilot gated to Mumbai; admin queue scoped to Mumbai reports
- `js/app.js`: NGO grantLeadAccess sets city from invite assignment
- `tests/e2e_comprehensive.py`: C34/C34b Pune citizen BMC entry hidden
- `sw.js`: cache bump v45 → v46

## Failures

_None_

## Limitations

- Supabase backend not configured — cloud sync, OTP auth, and cross-device tests are local-only.
- Photo moderation NSFW model skipped in headless (solid-color test images pass).
- PWA offline shell and service-worker stale-cache tests limited (SW blocked in automation).
- Camera permission denial uses geolocation mock proxy; real device camera not tested.
