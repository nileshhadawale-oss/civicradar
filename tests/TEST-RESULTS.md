# CivicRadar Test Results

**Run:** 2026-06-29 21:39:50
**Server:** http://localhost:9080/
**Script:** `tests/e2e_comprehensive.py`
**Total:** 366 | **Pass:** 366 | **Fail:** 0

## Fixes applied this run

- `assets/*` + `tools/gen_icons.py`: regenerated the "Pin + Ripple" PNG app-icon set from the REAL approved artwork (`assets/icon-source-pin-ripple.png`). gen_icons.py now crops the source card, removes the white page background (flood-fill) for clean full-bleed transparent corners, and composites the maskable on sampled indigo; icon filenames unchanged so manifest/index/SW references stay valid
- `supabase/schema.sql`: added an additive, re-runnable `feedback` table (message/category/contact/app_version/env/device/ward/city/user_id) with RLS mirroring analytics — anon/auth INSERT allowed, no public SELECT (service-role/dashboard reads only). FOUNDER MUST RE-RUN schema.sql once
- `index.html` + `js/app.js` + `css/styles.css`: in-app feedback form (Supabase-backed, offline-safe). Entry points in Profile + About; accessible modal (focus trap, aria-live error, 44px targets, native-radio segmented control); inserts to Supabase when connected, else stores locally and flushes on reconnect (never loses text); all strings localized in en/hi/mr/gu
- `css/styles.css`: launch visual polish (v69) — extended design tokens (cyan accent, elevation/radii scale, brand gradients), confident button states with springy tap feedback, refined modal/toast/card depth, premium map chrome, segmented control + inline form-error + brand input focus rings + skeleton-loader utility — all motion gated by prefers-reduced-motion
- `js/config.js`: consolidated all contact/legal emails onto a single role inbox `civicradarnh@gmail.com` (legal.grievanceEmail, founder.email, founder.operatorEmail) — removed all personal Gmail addresses from deployable/source files (privacy.html / terms.html links are config-driven and now resolve to the role inbox)
- `css/styles.css`: launch polish (v71) — consistency pass extending the v69 surface system to screens it missed: branded Leaflet map chrome (brand/devanagari typography, modal-matched popups, cohesive zoom controls with focus rings + larger close target), premium podium emphasis on the leaderboard (ranks 1–3), resting elevation on queue + hazard cards, and a warmer on-brand empty-state icon. Additive only; motion gated by prefers-reduced-motion
- `index.html`: added a graceful `<noscript>` fallback (inline-styled, English + Hindi + Marathi) so JS-disabled or bundle-failure visitors get a friendly reload prompt instead of a blank screen
- `supabase/schema.sql`: coordinator access requests + approval workflow (v72) — new `access_requests` table with RLS (anon/auth INSERT *pending only*; admin-only SELECT/UPDATE), `admin` super-admin role added to `profiles`, and SECURITY-DEFINER RPCs `request_access`, `approve_access_request`, `reject_access_request`, `claim_access` (+ `is_admin`/`gen_claim_code`). Approval issues a one-time claim code. FOUNDER MUST RE-RUN schema.sql once + bootstrap one super-admin
- `index.html` + `js/app.js` + `css/styles.css`: in-app coordinator access request flow (NGO + BMC). Low-friction request form (name + role + one contact required; org/ward/proof/note optional; submits without login), confirmation panel, claim-code entry, and an admin-only review screen (one-tap approve/reject) reachable from the BMC queue. Works fully in local/no-Supabase mode (on-device queue). All strings localized in en/hi/mr/gu
- `sw.js`: cache bump → v72 (static assets changed: index.html + styles.css + app.js)
- `tests/e2e_comprehensive.py`: SW06 expected cache version → v72; added Access suite (AR01–AR11)
- `js/app.js`: fix report photo flow race after native camera accept (popstate + Map ghost tap); advance to Submit step; cache bump v73

- `js/app.js`: export `window.closeAllModals` for automation/E2E callers
- `tests/e2e_comprehensive.py`: Access AR06/AR10 use safe modal close; hardened Leaflet waits (`wait_for_map_ready`, popup/marker waits)
- `js/app.js` + `index.html` + `css/styles.css`: magic-link primary auth UX — send sign-in link, post-send instructions, collapsed OTP fallback; callback handler for hash errors + NGO code redeem; `emailRedirectTo: publicUrl`
- `RELEASE.md`: §10 Supabase URL config + optional SMTP/OTP note
- `sw.js` + `tests/e2e_comprehensive.py`: v76 cache bump; ML01–ML09 magic-link auth UI + error tests; SW06 → v76
- `tests/e2e_comprehensive.py`: ensure_server verifies CivicRadar content (not Windows-reserved 8095 listener); port fallbacks 8097–8787; RP05 waits for report modal open
- `js/app.js` + `index.html`: second-pass review — contact-neutral coordinator access copy (phone-only path); admin OTP verify accepts super-admin role; magic-link callback errors via formatAuthError; claim-code copy toast fixed; bottom-nav ghost-tap guard during camera; Twitter share no duplicate hashtags
- `sw.js` + `tests/e2e_comprehensive.py`: v77 cache bump; AR12 phone-only confirm copy; AU01 admin OTP role check; SW06 → v77
- `tests/e2e_comprehensive.py`: ensure_server uses stdlib http.server + shorter probe timeout (fixes Windows 8095 HTTP.sys hang during test startup)
- `js/app.js` + `index.html` + `css/styles.css`: warm kudos on EVERY report (rotating non-milestone copy) + new `#successProgress` progress-to-next-badge nudge; localized en/hi/mr/gu
- `sw.js` + `tests/e2e_comprehensive.py`: v78 cache bump; RP13–RP15 kudos/progress tests; X29 progress element; SW06 → v78
- `index.html` + `js/app.js` + `css/styles.css`: onboarding "How it works" why/3-step explainer + report-on-the-spot coach guidance (OB10–OB13, C09b); opt-in "report stagnant water nearby" reminder toggle in Profile with graceful Notification/iOS fallback + location-aware in-app nudge built on the existing reminder queue (RR01–RR07); localized en/hi/mr/gu
- `sw.js` + `tests/e2e_comprehensive.py`: v79 cache bump; SW06 → v79
- `index.html` + `js/app.js` + `css/styles.css`: first-run interactive coach-mark tour (v80) — skippable spotlight guided tour (Map → Report FAB → Me too → Profile) sequenced right after the v79 coachSpotTip explainer; shown once (`civicradar_tour_seen`), re-watchable via a "Replay app tour" entry in Profile; spotlight + bubble positioned from bounding rects, keyboard operable (Tab/Enter/Esc), focus-managed, backdrop/ESC dismiss, prefers-reduced-motion respected; suppressed for demo/referral/returning users; localized en/hi/mr/gu (TR01–TR09)
- `sw.js` + `tests/e2e_comprehensive.py`: v80 cache bump; SW06 → v80
- `index.html` + `js/app.js` + `css/styles.css`: location banner UX (v81) — added a dismiss "×" control that snoozes the banner for 7 days (`civicradar_locbanner_snooze`) and collapses it into an unobtrusive "Locate me" pill that re-runs the enable-location flow on tap (bypassing snooze); success and explicit taps clear the snooze and hide both; all banner copy localized via `t()` (location.banner/bannerNearby/unavailable/withdrawn/dismiss/locate/locateAria) in en/hi/mr/gu (LB01–LB06)
- `sw.js` + `tests/e2e_comprehensive.py`: v81 cache bump; SW06 → v81

- `sw.js` + `tests/e2e_comprehensive.py`: v84 cache bump; SW06 → v84
- `index.html` + `js/app.js` + `css/styles.css`: home/landing hero (v85) — #MonsoonGuardian stagnant-water hero above FAB (WHAT/WHY/HOW/trust), dismissible until first report; enhanced empty-map card with gradient drop icon; localized en/hi/mr/gu (HM01–HM07)

## Failures

_None_

## Limitations

- Supabase backend not configured — cloud sync, magic-link auth, and cross-device tests are local-only.
- Photo moderation NSFW model skipped in headless (solid-color test images pass).
- PWA offline shell and service-worker stale-cache tests limited (SW blocked in automation).
- Camera permission denial uses geolocation mock proxy; real device camera not tested.
